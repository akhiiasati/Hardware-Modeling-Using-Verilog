## Concept of Verilog Module

In Verilog, the fundamental building block of hardware design is called a module. Understanding the characteristics of modules is crucial for creating organized and scalable digital designs. Here are key points to consider:

- `Module Definition:` A module in Verilog represents a self-contained unit that encapsulates a specific functionality or component within a digital system.

- `Limitation on Module Definitions:` Importantly, a module cannot contain definitions of other modules directly. Each module is intended to encapsulate a specific aspect of the overall design.

- `Module Instantiation:` Despite the limitation on containing module definitions, Verilog allows modules to be instantiated within other modules. This instantiation capability facilitates a modular and hierarchical design approach.

- `Hierarchy through Instantiation:` The process of instantiation enables the creation of a hierarchy in Verilog descriptions. Designers can break down complex systems into smaller, manageable modules and instantiate them as needed, promoting a structured and organized design methodology.

Understanding these principles is essential for Verilog designers, as it allows them to efficiently manage complexity, enhance code readability, and promote a modular design approach for digital systems.

### Verilog Module Structure

```verilog

// Verilog Module Template

// Module Declaration
module module_name (list_of_ports);

  // Section 1: Input/Output Declarations
  // -----------------------------------
  // Declare input and output ports for the module.
  input/output declarations;

  // Section 2: Local Net Declarations
  // --------------------------------
  // Declare local wires or registers for internal connections.
  wire/reg declarations;

  // Section 3: Parallel Statements
  // -----------------------------
  // Write Verilog code representing the functionality of the module.
  // This section contains the actual logic of the module.
  // You can include both combinational and sequential statements here.

endmodule
```
